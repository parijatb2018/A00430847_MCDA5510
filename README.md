My name is Parijat Bandyopadhyay. I am a Mechanical Engineer having 13 years of experience in the field of oil and gas and as a stress engineer/lead stress engineer. I have been a part of many mega projects during my tenure with reputed companies like, Reliance Industries Ltd, Bechtel, Shell, Aramco , Woods Group and Toyo. My highest education is Masters in Mechanical Engineering.
Since my undergraduate days I have been in love with computer programming. I learnt C during my bachelors. During my masterâ€™s thesis I developed a pump simulation model in MATLAB and Simulink and that gave more boost to my liking. In last 13 years, I have developed many in-house utility sheets/software in VBA/Excel for the companies I worked with and saved their time and money.
As a lead engineer I had to handle huge data and mostly I used to do it by making utility programs. As, I love simulating/predicting outcomes and also creating utilities, after this course, I would like to work as a Machine Learning engineer and also as a software developer.

Presently, I am learning C# and Java. I would like to build solid concepts on these two and also in MySQL Server.

I am looking for your encouragement and help to unleash my passion for programming and justify my decision to switch in this field.

Best Regards
Parijat
